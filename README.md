# Online-Shared-Document-Editor

I developed a website that enables users to securely share documents with each other, either individually or in groups. As part of the development process, I implemented various security measures to ensure the privacy and integrity of user data.  To prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data, I followed the best practice of not storing database credentials in the source code, instead storing them in a separate configuration file with restricted access. Additionally, I ensured that users could only access their own documents and those shared with them, preventing any unauthorized access to unshared documents.  To protect user credentials, I employed a strong password policy and implemented password hashing in the database to further secure the password information. To prevent any malicious users from accessing the actual contents of the shared documents, I encrypted the document contents using a secure encryption algorithm.  Furthermore, to guard against common security threats such as SQL injection attacks, I utilized parameterized queries for all database transactions. I also implemented secure communication protocols (such as HTTPS) to prevent interception and tampering of data during transmission.
